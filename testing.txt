                              Test Cases
                            =============

1.  Request Evaluation aborts due to conflict in Subject Attribute

    Config File:    subjectConflict.ini
    Log File:       subjectConflict.log

    Description:
    Scenario:   Tom can watch Star Wars max two times
                Number of Clients:          2
                Number of requests sent:    2 (per client)
                Subject Attributes:         name="Tom" viewCount="&lt;2"
                Resource Attributes:        type="movie"
                Action:                     name="view"
                Two requests should be allowed
                Two requests should be denied
    Two clients with same subject and resource ID for same action send two
    requests each. All these requests try to update the same subject attribute
    resulting in a conflict and hence a restart due to conflict in Subject
    Attribute.

    Artificial Delays inserted:
    None

    Outcome:
    The test passed as expected.
    Number of allowed accesses: 2   (grep on log: "Allow access")
    Number of denied accesses:  2   (grep on log: "Deny access")
    Number of conflicts:        2   (grep on log: "Subject Coordinator:
                                                            Conflict Happened:")
    DB updated:
        Initial Snapshot    (part of DB relevant to this example)
            Subject Attributes = {'4444': {'viewCount': '0', 'name': 'Tom'}}
	        Resource Attributes = {'666': {'movie': 'StarWars'}}
	    Final Snapshot      (part of DB relevant to this example)
	        Subject Attributes = {'4444': {'viewCount': '2', 'name': 'Tom'}}
	        Resource Attributes = {'666': {'movie': 'StarWars'}}
