README.txt should contain the following sections:

  INSTRUCTIONS.  instructions to build and run your system.  the
  instructions should not assume that an IDE is installed.  provide
  a detailed sequence of commands, a shell sript, a Makefile, or something
  similar.  include a specific example of the command to run a selected
  testcase.

  MAIN FILES.  The full pathname of the files containing the main code
  for the client, coordinator, worker, and master.  (this will help
  graders look at the most important code first.)

  BUGS AND LIMITATIONS.  a list of all known bugs in and limitations of
  your code.

  CONTRIBUTIONS.  a list of contributions of each team member to the
  current submission.  this should reflect how the work was divided between
  the team members.  generally, a dozen lines or so is sufficient detail.

  OTHER COMMENTS.  anything else you want us to know.
